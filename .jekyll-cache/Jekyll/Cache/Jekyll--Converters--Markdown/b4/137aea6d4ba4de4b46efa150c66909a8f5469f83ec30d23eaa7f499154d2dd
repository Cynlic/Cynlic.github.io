I"Ø<p>While slightly less visible than the nightlife scene making its post-vaccination comeback, one would be hard-pressed to live in Austin long and not notice the abundance of green space which threads through the city in a series of greenbelts, metropolitan parks, and natural landmarks.
Such spaces have long been a major part of the city‚Äôs attraction to ‚Äúknowledge workers,‚Äù and have offered a manicured common space for hiking, biking, rock climbing, water activities and more.
However, as Andrew Busch (2017) contends, the taught loop of rhetoric which surrounds environmentalism, sustainablity, and ‚Äúgreenness‚Äù has long been a entwined with the city‚Äôs ‚Äúprogressive investment in whiteness.‚Äù 
The city‚Äôs production of a unique interface between burgeoning technopolis and manicured garden has engendered particular inequities across lines of class and race which grant the experience of these spaces as fraught forms of recreation.</p>

<p>The antiPode is an experimental object which asks a simple question: <em>how can we listen against the grain of the environmental narrative?</em>
While the project is theoretically ongoing, it has taken definable shape as a three step process:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Make recordings of Austin greenspace, attempting to focus on features of their emplacement in the city (i.e. emphasize the unique ways they mediate traffic noise rather than idyllic bird song.</li>
  <li></li>
</ol>
